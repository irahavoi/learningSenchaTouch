 * Why use Sencha cmd:
	- It is cross-platform
	- Code-generation tools: concatenate/minify your app, generate code stubs for controllers, views, models, forms, profiles
	- Good documentation
	- Multiple build targets: testing, production, native builds.
	- Integration with UglifyJS, Google closure compiler or YUI Compressor.
	- Native packaging: wrap your app into a native packager for further distribution in Google Play or Apple App Store.
	- Automation hooks with or without ant.
 * Generating app is as easy as : sencha generate app myApp (from the folder with sencha's sdk)
 * With Sencha Touch device profiles you can get extremely granular
   and create specific profiles for different devices and name them exactly how
   you want to. For example, you could have one profile for iPhone4, another
   for iPhone5, another for SamsungGS3 (Galaxy S3), and so forth.

* sencha web --port 8080 start <-- Starts a web server.
* sencha app build testing <-- builds the app and puts the result to build/testing
* localStorage is available in the global scope
