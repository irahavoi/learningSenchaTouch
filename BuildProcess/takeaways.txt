 * Why use Sencha cmd:
	- It is cross-platform
	- Code-generation tools: concatenate/minify your app, generate code stubs for controllers, views, models, forms, profiles
	- Good documentation
	- Multiple build targets: testing, production, native builds.
	- Integration with UglifyJS, Google closure compiler or YUI Compressor.
	- Native packaging: wrap your app into a native packager for further distribution in Google Play or Apple App Store.
	- Automation hooks with or without ant.
 * Generating app is as easy as : sencha generate app myApp (from the folder with sencha's sdk)
