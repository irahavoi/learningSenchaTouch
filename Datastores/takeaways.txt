* All proxies, except the default Memory proxy, load data asynchronously,
* Proxies are used in the stores to load data (e.g. Ext.data.proxy.Ajax).
* Types of proxies: Ajax, Direct, JsonP, LocalStorage, Memory.
  so you need to use a callback or an event to take action when a store loads.
* Use Ext.data.reader.Json to decode json responses (preferred)
* Use Ext.data.reader.Xml to decode xml responses
* Writers are used  to include new, edited, or destroyed records in the sync request from the store.
  You execute a sync request by executing the sync method on the store, and if there are
  any dirty records they’ll be included in the request. A “dirty record” is a record that’s
  new, edited, or destroyed. You’ll also see the term “phantom record,” which is a new
  record on the client side that hasn’t yet been synced with the server side.
* Stores are not loaded automaticallyu by default (use either config's autoload = true or load() method)
* XTemplate - emplate class that supports advanced templating functionality
* New in Sencha Touch 2.1, Ext.dataview.List now supports infinite data.
  List figures out how many rows can fit in the screen, adds some for a buffer, and reuses them on the fly as you’re scrolling.
